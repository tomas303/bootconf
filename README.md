# bootconf

I created this grub configuration file based on various resources I had found on the net. I use it to boot from various linux
iso files. Instead of creating new bootable stick each time I just put an iso into /boot/iso2 directory and menu is automaticly
added into "Boot iso file" submenu. Currently supported are SparkyLinux, Ubuntu, OpenSuse and ArchLinux. But it is trivial to add
other distros. As long as it supports boot from iso file and you know correct boot parameters.

More on how I prepared usb stick and what resources I used see https://tomas303.github.io/usb/boot/iso/2019/07/06/MultiBootUsbStick.html.
